## Summary

In our attempt to create a streamlined application to allow students to connect and aid each other through independent study sessions, we were faced with several challenges.  The first of which was how we would separate authentication routes for situations where a user or admin would be accessing the application:

authenticatedUser.js
```
module.exports = function (req, res, next) {
    if (req.user) {            
      if(req.user.role !== "admin"){
        return next();
      }
    }else{
      console.log("user doesn't exists")
      return res.redirect("/");
    }    
  };
```

App_User.js
```
import axios from 'axios'
export default {
    authenticate: function (loginData) {
        return axios.put("/api/user", loginData)
    },
    verifyUser: function (sessionId) {
        console.log("requesting verify")
        return axios.get("/api/user/verifyUser")
    },
```

App_user.js
```
router
  .route("/")
  .put(passport.authenticate("local"), function (req, res) {
    let user = { ...req.user.dataValues, password: "youWish" }
    res.json(user)
    console.log("login successful!")
  })

router
  .route("/verifyUser")
  .get(authenticatedUser,function (req, res) {
    console.log("verifying user")
    res.json(req.user)
  })
```

With an authenticated user now accessing the site, we were faced with another task of ensuring all data would be rendering properly depending on the user's actions.  Given that we are saving a plethora of data to state, it was vital that realtime updates to state would display accordingly, as executed by the following code:

profilePanel.js
```
    const oneClassSessions = (item) => {
        API_User.getSessionsForOneClass(item).then(classSess => {
            dispatch({
                type: "setAllSessions",
                sessions: classSess.data
            })
        })
    }

    const allClassSessions = () => {
        API_User.getAllUserSessions(state.currentUser.id).then(sessionResp => {
            dispatch({
                type: "setAllSessions",
                sessions: sessionResp.data
            })
        })
    }
```

GlobalState.js
```
case "setAllSessions":
      return {
        ...state,
        sessions: action.sessions,
      };
```      

With regards to the data that would be displayed, a complex set of data queries were executed through sequelize to pull data for each user, based upon the classes they are in, and any sessions they had signed up to attend. An example of the query for the sessions a user would be attending, please see the below code:

sessionController.js
```
module.exports = {
    findAllParticipatinSessions: function (req, res) {
        db.UserSession.findAll({
            where: {
                userId: req.params.userid
            },
            include: {
                model: db.Session,
                include: [{
                    model: db.Class,
                    attributes: ["subject", "class"]
                },{
                    model: db.User, as: "host",
                    attributes: ["firstName", "lastName", "image"]
                },{
                    model: db.UserSession,
                    include: {
                        model: db.User,
                        attributes: ["firstName", "lastName", "image"]
                    }
                },{
                    model: db.Location,
                    attributes: ["building", "room"]
                }]
            }
        }
        ).then(participatingSessions => {
            let allSessions = [];
            for (let i = 0; i < participatingSessions.length; i++) {
                let sessionInfo = participatingSessions[i].dataValues.Session.dataValues
                let classInfo = participatingSessions[i].dataValues.Session.Class.dataValues
                let hostInfo = participatingSessions[i].dataValues.Session.host.dataValues
                let locationInfo = participatingSessions[i].dataValues.Session.Location.dataValues
                let participants = participatingSessions[i].dataValues.Session.UserSessions
                const sessionObject = {}
                sessionObject.sessionId = sessionInfo.id
                sessionObject.hostid = sessionInfo.hostId
                sessionObject.userImage = hostInfo.image
                sessionObject.hostName = hostInfo.firstName + " " + hostInfo.lastName
                sessionObject.classId = sessionInfo.ClassId
                sessionObject.className = classInfo.subject + " " + classInfo.class
                sessionObject.sessionSubject = sessionInfo.subject
                let formattedDate = moment(sessionInfo.sessionDate).format("M-D-YY hh:mm a")
                sessionObject.sessionDate = formattedDate
                sessionObject.participants = participants
                sessionObject.locationBuilding = locationInfo.building
                sessionObject.locationRoom =locationInfo.room
                allSessions.push(sessionObject)
            }
            res.json(allSessions)
        })
            .catch(err => res.status(422).json(err));
    },
```

To demonstrate the functionality of the application, we present the following gif:

## Learning-Points

The challenge of this application pushed our team to consider a real work use case for a product.  Included with that was the consideration of how we would best use the technology available to deploy our app.  While we wanted to explore a full MERN stack, with the database we were constructing, using Mongo as our database was not really the best direction.  This did not take away from our experience in building out a complex database to work for our React application.

## Tests

As this application is not designed to allow just anyone to be able to Sign-up, anyone who wishes to review the application can use the following test logins to review from a user's perspective:

`User email - cbell@ucb.edu; User password - testing`

`User email - jmejia@ucb.edu; User password - testing`

`User email - tjohnson@ucb.edu; User password - testing`

`User email - bblackwell@ucb.edu; User password - testing`

`User email - hcraig@ucb.edu; User password - testing`

`User email - jknox@ucb.edu; User password - testing`

`User email - mrobertson@ucb.edu ; User password - testing`

All "students" and "admins" were set up with "testing" as the password, so in theory, all user emails from the sample DB can use the password testing for loging for a review of the application.
